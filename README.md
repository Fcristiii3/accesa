The application is built using Spring Boot and the java version is 17. The database I am using is H2, so it is not tied to my local machine, and the data is held in memory. Since this is a demo and the CSV files are read at every run, I don't think that the data's persistence is an issue. The server port is 9090, and every endpoint starts with http://localhost:9090/homepage/product/ Constraint: only one discount active for a specific product, in a specific store.
